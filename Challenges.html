he cognitive capabilities of current architectures
 are very limited, using only a simplified version of 
what intelligence is really capable of. For instance,
 the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond 
measure and logical explanations to different 
occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise 
straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may 
be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to 
using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes 
of models: structuralist and functionalist. 
The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic 
intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning 
and logic. The functional model refers to the 
correlating data to its computed counterpart.
The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.
