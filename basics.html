    <h2>Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents":
 any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance 
of successfully achieving its goals.[3] A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as 
"a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use 
those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.</h2>

<p>1-If someone has a "threat" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,</p>
<p>2-if a move "forks" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,</p>
<p>3-take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,</p>
<p>4-if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,</p>
<p>5-take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,</p>
<p>6-take any empty square.</p>
